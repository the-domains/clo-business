            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Our goal is to create a community in which dressing and shopping will be easier than it has ever been
before. Clo is a revolutionary app that allows everyone to categorize their own style; making each
article of clothing browsable and obtainable to the world. This service helps people to explore their
individual style and allows them to get a sense of when and where to wear their desired attire.
</h1><p>Incorporated in Clo will be an all-in-one virtual mall. The user will be able to interact with different stores
and their apparel as if they were actually in the mall. A virtual mall has the capability of expanding
and including those brands which users have an interest, while not being limited by the construction
and expansion of a physical mall. Additionally, Clo has integrated 3D imaging allowing users to
interact with the apparel and guarantee their desired fit. This service allows people to shop at the
comfort of their homes, shop during breaks in their busy schedules, and shop without the fear of any
judgment.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Within the mobile app, Clo provides services from both the social networking aspect and the e-commerce aspect. Clo creates an environment for the customer to browse different styles and outfits through a wide range of presentation in the "Feed". Clo is more than a professional look-book or a magazine spread. Clo provides users the comfortability to express oneself without professional intimidation. Within each picture posted by your friend, your family or even by an international model, you can single tap on the picture to see the "Tags". These tags on the article of clothing are direct links to the actual store of the item being sold.</p>]]></description>
