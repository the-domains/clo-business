# Product + Services

Within the mobile app, Clo provides services from both the social networking aspect and the e-commerce aspect. Clo creates an environment for the customer to browse different styles and outfits through a wide range of presentation in the "Feed". Clo is more than a professional look-book or a magazine spread. Clo provides users the comfortability to express oneself without professional intimidation. Within each picture posted by your friend, your family or even by an international model, you can single tap on the picture to see the "Tags". These tags on the article of clothing are direct links to the actual store of the item being sold.

Clo profiles allow users to send gifts to friends and family without asking for their size or a shipping address. Additionally, 3D body imagery lets senders decide whether or not an outfit looks good on the receiver before the gift is sent. Potential gifts can be tried on to mix and match with what is already posted in a user's Clo profile.
