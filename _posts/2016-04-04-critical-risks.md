_Competition Adaption_

- In the highly competitive market of e-commerce, the competition has the capability to adapt to special features and create similar models. Clo will center its focus around these features but separates itself from the competition by its execution. Clo is represented through its execution and goal of instilling confidence in people to be comfortable with who they are.

_Lack of Store Collaboration_

- Online stores may be hesitant to join Clo due to exclusivity. However, direct links that lead users to their page within Clo would be beneficial for website traffic and sales. There are always new enticements that can be developed to encourage shops/boutiques collaborations. Things such as promotions and clothing updates can easily be spread to a greater audience through the Clo app. Clo brings a larger global audience for smaller boutiques and allows larger boutiques to reach the corners of the globe. We believe that with the addition of a couple of large franchises to Clo, many other stores would follow.

_Privacy/Security Lawsuits_

- Clo is not going to save any purchasing (credit card) information since all purchases will be made through the original affiliated store domain. Security for purchases will be from the sites in which purchases will be made. Therefore liability will be with the clothing company and not Clo. Pictures in our database are provided by users and there will be public and private profile settings.

_Database Crashes_

- There will be a weekly database check and automatic crash reports sent from the app whenever a problem may occur. Additionally users may submit problems directly to Clo. Automatic updates will be made accordingly. Clo is designed to be a transparent company willing to work with users so they can have the most enjoyable experience.
