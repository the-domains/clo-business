_Launch Event with Open Invitation_

An invite-only launch party consisting of friends and family along with investors and key contributors (models, editors, bloggers) that will be hired to use and promote Clo and Clo.E. This event will be live-streamed on the website through Youtube. During this period of time while the event is happening, people from around the world are able to access the app and create their own profiles. This will be consider as the Open-Invite Stage.

_Invitation Only_

After the launch event, access to the app to create an account will be closed. This will be consider as the Invite-Only Stage. Friends and family can share the app with their personal codes. Models and bloggers can also share the app with their special codes to their already existing followers. Each share includes benefits that the owner of the code will receive. Bloggers, models, and editors will be competing for a new Clo ranking and compensation based on the amount of followers they gain.

_Mission Highlight Focus_

Our mission is more than just creating a convenience in choosing different outfits. Clo goes deeper and seeks to inspire the user to feel great about themselves and to instill confidence in others. Users will be able to expand their network and share their style all around the world.

* Accessibility

Clo creates an easier method of obtaining desired apparel with the Tagging 

feature that leads you directly to where you can purchase the item.

* Convenience

Users will experience the full virtual tailoring experience with 3D profiling 

located within Clo.

* Efficiency

Clo's operation system is another factor that separates this app from the others. The operation system is designed to be fast, virtually pleasing, and style enhancing.

Confidence Booster

- Clo is not any ordinary app that tailors to our customer's needs. We promote growth in every person that uses the app. Clo's mission is to create the confidence in every person without the feeling of judgement.

Creativity Enhancer

- Clo is a global brand reaching regions all over the globe. It enables users to see what the other side of the world is wearing. Pen Pal is old school! Why not use Clo? It diffuses innovation by sharing styles, fashion, and advice.

New Feature Introductions

As beta is out, we will evaluate and introduce new features as they are developed. Through the analytics and feedback, we will know whether the features are relevant or not.

College Campus Ambassadors

College students will be hired to set up booths at their schools to promote the use of the app. They will be given a quota of invites to increase the amount of profiles made. This way of marketing includes competitions amongst different organizations or Greek houses. There will be free giveaways and prizes for winners of competitions.

Promotions and Special In-App Deals

Exclusive deals can be made through agreements with specific boutiques and shops. Sweepstakes for free prizes or even a whole outfit could be a program to increase user flow.

User Feedback

The feedback from users is very important to us. Since it is a start-up, we want to hear about all the important needs and unnecessary features. With the feedback we get, we will be able to enhance the app and website in a more user-friendly way and create a closer connection between Clo and its users. We are creating a comfortable environment for users to be on daily.
