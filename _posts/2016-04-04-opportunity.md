Moving from Orange County with three of the greatest malls surrounding your city to Champaign-Urbana with one insufficient mall is hard. But what if a person was able to shop at those malls without actually being present at the mall. This led me to the idea of building a virtual mall.

Location is not the only main concern that I noticed at the University. People here often ask:

> What should I wear to an interview?

> What is business casual, what is business professional?

> What should I wear to a barn dance? to a social? to a concert? (We don't have barn dances back in California) 

All these questions led to the idea of building an all-in-one fashion social network. A place where people can go to figure out what others are wearing today, what they have worn before, and what they wear to express their individuality.

With direct links, Clo makes life easier for guys and girls who are inexperienced online shoppers. They can easily check out what they like and purchase apparel without the hassle of searching endlessly through people's social media accounts. With categories, Clo makes browsing easier for guys and girls to find the right outfits for certain occasions, whether it is a date night or a MBA class.

Gifting season happens about three or four times a year including birthdays, Christmas, Valentine's Day, and even Mothers'/Fathers' Day. With these events always comes the constant struggle:

> What size are they now?

> What is their shipping address?

> What do they currently like and wear?

Now, Clo's got you covered. A shipping address is connected to your personal profile which you can share with your close friends. Personal taste is express through pictures. Additionally, clothing sizes and fit can be inputed and shared within your personal profile.

Soon you will have the option to have a 3D image of your body in which you can attach to your personal profile. This will allow for trying on clothes virtually and see how it looks and fits on your body, all without a changing room. You can share your body image to a friend and it will expire after 24 hours for security reasons and of course, your body change constantly.
